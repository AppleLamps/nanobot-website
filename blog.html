                <p>Hey everyone. If you're here, you're probably like me — you can't stop thinking about this case. I've
                    been following the Nancy Guthrie disappearance since the news broke, and I need somewhere to put all
                    these thoughts. This blog is my attempt to make sense of everything we know, ask the questions that
                    keep me up at night, and maybe — just maybe — help piece something together. Let's figure this out
                    together. 🔍</p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Day 17: The Suspect Description and 13,000 Tips</h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>It's Day 17. The FBI has released a detailed description of the suspect, and the numbers are staggering: over 13,000 tips to the FBI, more than 18,000 calls to the Pima County Sheriff's Department. This case has captured the nation's attention like few others.</p>

                    <h3>The Suspect Description: What We Now Know</h3>

                    <p>On February 12, the FBI released specific details about the person seen in the doorbell camera footage:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Height:</strong> 5 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 10 inches</li>
                        <li><strong>Build:</strong> Medium</li>
                        <li><strong>Backpack:</strong> Black 24-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This level of specificity is significant. The FBI doesn't release details like this unless they're confident in the information. The backpack description in particular suggests they were able to enhance the video footage enough to identify the brand and model.</p>

                    <h3>The Video Recovery: A Technical Triumph</h3>

                    <p>Here's something that hasn't gotten enough attention: the doorbell camera didn't have an active subscription. No cloud storage. No live monitoring. But the FBI's Operational Technology Division was able to recover footage from "residual backend data" — essentially digital fragments left on the device's servers.</p>

                    <p>This is remarkable work. Director Kash Patel specifically highlighted this technical achievement, and it shows the level of resources being devoted to this case. The FBI isn't just investigating — they're deploying cutting-edge digital forensics.</p>

                    <h3>The Numbers Game</h3>

                    <p>13,000+ tips. 18,000+ calls. Those are massive numbers for a case that's only 17 days old. But here's the thing: quantity doesn't equal quality. Investigators have to sort through every single tip, determine which are credible, and follow up on leads that pan out.</p>

                    <p>The $100,000 reward is clearly driving public interest. But it's also creating challenges. The FBI has had to deal with fake ransom attempts (Derrick Callella), conspiracy theories, and what Sheriff Nanos called "reckless" media reporting that could compromise the investigation.</p>

                    <h3>Carlos Palazuelos: The Released Person of Interest</h3>

                    <p>We now know the name of the man detained on February 11: Carlos Palazuelos, a delivery driver from Rio Rico. He was stopped during a traffic stop, questioned for hours, and released without charges.</p>

                    <p>Palazuelos told Telemundo he had no knowledge of the kidnapping and didn't recall delivering anything to Guthrie's house. Sheriff Nanos confirmed he was cooperative and emphasized that "no one has been eliminated" from the investigation.</p>

                    <p>What does this mean? Either they cleared him completely, or they're watching him while building a larger case. The fact that they searched his home and vehicle suggests they had specific reasons to be interested in him. But without charges, we can only speculate.</p>

                    <h3>The DNA Glove: Still Waiting</h3>

                    <p>The black glove found two miles from Nancy's home remains the most promising physical evidence. The FBI confirmed it "appears to match" the gloves worn by the suspect in the surveillance video. Preliminary DNA results came back over the weekend, and the profile is being entered into CODIS — the FBI's national DNA database.</p>

                    <p>If that DNA matches someone in the system, this case could break wide open. If it doesn't, investigators still have a genetic profile they can use to compare against future suspects.</p>

                    <h3>The International Question</h3>

                    <p>Several reports have suggested the latest ransom communication hints at an international angle — possibly that the suspect has fled the US. President Trump was asked about cartel or nation-state involvement and responded: "You can't say that yet. It's a little bit early."</p>

                    <p>I'm skeptical of the international angle. It feels like a distraction tactic — something to make law enforcement look in the wrong direction. But if it's true, the complexity of this case just increased exponentially.</p>

                    <h3>Where We Stand</h3>

                    <p>After 17 days, here's my assessment:</p>

                    <p>1. <strong>Law enforcement is making progress.</strong> The suspect description, the DNA evidence, the video recovery — these are concrete developments.</p>

                    <p>2. <strong>The public is engaged.</strong> 13,000 tips means someone out there knows something. It's just a matter of finding the right information.</p>

                    <p>3. <strong>Nancy's medical situation is critical.</strong> 17 days without her heart medication. If she's still alive, someone is providing care. If she's not... I don't want to finish that sentence.</p>

                    <p>4. <strong>The kidnapper is still communicating.</strong> The fact that ransom messages continue suggests they haven't given up on getting paid. That means they need Nancy alive — or they need law enforcement to believe she's alive.</p>

                    <div class="disclaimer-box">
                        ⚠️ <strong>Reward:</strong> The FBI has increased the reward to $100,000 for information leading to Nancy Guthrie's recovery and/or the arrest and conviction of those responsible. If you know anything, call 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or submit tips at tips.fbi.gov.

                        developments in the past 48 hours that have completely shifted how I'm thinking about this
                        investigation.</p>

                    <p>Let me break down what's happened and what it might mean.</p>

                    <h3>The Black Glove: DNA Evidence Emerges</h3>

                    <p>This is the biggest development. The FBI confirmed that a black glove found about two miles from
                        Nancy's home <em>appears to match the gloves worn by the suspect in the surveillance video</em>.
                        The glove has been sent to a private lab in Florida for DNA testing, and preliminary results
                        came back Saturday.</p>

                    <p>Here's why this is huge: If there's DNA on that glove, and it matches someone in the FBI's CODIS
                        database, we could have a name. A face. A suspect. The FBI is waiting for quality control
                        confirmation before entering the profile into the database — a process that takes about 24
                        hours.</p>

                    <p>But here's what keeps me up at night: They found 16 gloves total. Most were from searchers. But
                        this one was different. This one had DNA that doesn't belong to Nancy or her close contacts.
                        Someone else's DNA is on that glove.</p>

                    <h3>The Range Rover at Culver's</h3>

                    <p>Friday night, law enforcement converged on a Culver's parking lot near 1st Avenue and River Road.
                        They towed a gray Range Rover. They executed a search warrant at a residence about two miles
                        from Nancy's home. And they detained a man for questioning.</p>

                    <p>That man was later released. Sheriff Nanos confirmed he was a "person of interest" but said "no
                        one has been eliminated" from the investigation. The Range Rover was towed "as part of the
                        search warrant."</p>

                    <p>So what does this mean? Either they didn't find what they were looking for, or they're building a
                        case before making an arrest. The fact that they released him suggests they don't have enough
                        yet — or they're watching him to see where he leads them.</p>

                    <h3>The International Angle</h3>

                    <p>This is where things get really interesting. Multiple reports suggest the latest ransom email
                        hints that the suspect may have fled the US. One report specifically says: "Be prepared to go
                        international."</p>

                    <p>If Nancy has been taken out of the country, this changes everything. The investigation becomes
                        exponentially more complex. Jurisdictional issues. International law enforcement coordination.
                        Extraction possibilities.</p>

                    <p>But I'm skeptical. This could be a bluff. A distraction. A way to make law enforcement look in
                        the wrong direction while the real perpetrator is still local. Or it could be real. We just
                        don't know yet.</p>

                    <h3>The Fake Ransom Scammer: Derrick Callella</h3>

                    <p>While all this was happening, we learned that a 42-year-old California man named Derrick Callella
                        was arrested for sending fake ransom texts to Nancy's family. He demanded Bitcoin, used a VOIP
                        account, and admitted he got the family's information from a "cyber website."</p>

                    <p>He was released on $20,000 bond. Which is infuriating. But it highlights something important: the
                        real kidnapper is still out there. This guy was just an opportunist trying to profit from
                        tragedy.</p>

                    <h3>The FBI Doubles the Reward</h3>

                    <p>The FBI increased the reward from $50,000 to $100,000. They've received over 13,000 tips. The
                        Pima County Sheriff's Department has taken 18,000 calls. This case has the full attention of
                        federal law enforcement.</p>

                    <h3>My Analysis: Where We Stand</h3>

                    <p>After 16 days, here's what I believe:</p>

                    <p>1. <strong>This was planned.</strong> The doorbell camera was disabled. The suspect wore gloves,
                        a mask, and had a holstered weapon. The ransom demands came through encrypted channels. This
                        wasn't opportunistic.</p>

                    <p>2. <strong>There may be multiple people involved.</strong> The sophistication of the
                        communication, the potential international angle, the DNA on the glove found two miles away —
                        this suggests coordination.</p>

                    <p>3. <strong>Nancy may still be alive.</strong> I know the medical reality is grim. But if the
                        kidnappers want ransom money, they need her alive. The fact that they're still communicating
                        suggests they haven't given up on getting paid.</p>

                    <p>4. <strong>Law enforcement is close.</strong> The DNA evidence. The person of interest. The
                        search warrants. They're building something. I can feel it.</p>

                    <div class="disclaimer-box">
                        ⚠️ <strong>Reward Increased:</strong> The FBI has increased the reward to $100,000 for

                    <span>📅 February 7, 2026</span>

                <h2 class="post-title">Day 8: The Clock Ticks Toward Monday's Deadline</h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>It's been eight days since Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in Catalina Foothills. Eight
                        days without her heart medication. Eight days of her family waiting, hoping, pleading. And now
                        we're less than 48 hours from the second ransom deadline set for Monday, February 9.</p>

                    <p>I've been trying to make sense of where we are in this investigation. Here's what's keeping me up
                        tonight.</p>

                    <h3>What Harvey Levin Revealed</h3>

                    <p>TMZ founder Harvey Levin went on Hannity Thursday night and dropped some information that I think
                        is significant. He said the ransom note his newsroom received contained <em>specific non-public
                            details</em> about the inside of Nancy's home — including the exact placement of an Apple
                        Watch.</p>

                    <p>Why does this matter? Because it strongly suggests whoever wrote that note has actually been
                        inside Nancy's house. This isn't some random scammer in a basement somewhere making things up.
                        This person knows the layout. They know where things are.</p>

                    <blockquote>"There is a phrase in this email that absolutely makes me believe this person who wrote
                        this, and if they're telling the truth, that Nancy is within a radius of the Tucson area — not
                        in Tucson right now, but in a radius. It could be New Mexico." — Harvey Levin</blockquote>

                    <h3>The Geographic Radius</h3>

                    <p>Levin's comment about Nancy being held "within a radius of Tucson" is fascinating. If she's been
                        moved out of Arizona entirely — to New Mexico, for example — that changes the jurisdictional
                        picture significantly. It could also explain why the investigation has expanded to "adjacent
                        states" as reported by the New York Times.</p>

                    <p>Tucson is about an hour from the Mexican border. It's about 4 hours to Phoenix, 6 hours to
                        Albuquerque. If someone wanted to disappear with a victim, there are a lot of directions they
                        could go.</p>

                    <h3>The "Strong Clues" Comment</h3>

                    <p>President Trump told reporters Friday evening that authorities "have some clues I think that are
                        very strong" and that answers could be coming "fairly soon." Now, I take political statements
                        with a massive grain of salt, but the specificity here is interesting. He didn't just say "we're
                        working hard" — he said "very strong" clues.</p>

                    <p>Does law enforcement know more than they're saying? Almost certainly. They'd be irresponsible to
                        show all their cards while Nancy is still missing. But the gap between what's being reported
                        publicly and what investigators actually know has to be substantial at this point.</p>

                    <h3>The Medical Reality Check</h3>

                    <p>I keep coming back to this because I can't stop thinking about it. Nancy is 84 years old. She has
                        a pacemaker. She needs daily heart medication that — according to early reports — could be fatal
                        if not taken within 24 hours.</p>

                    <p>It's been eight days.</p>

                    <p>Either those early reports were exaggerated, or someone is providing her with medication. If the
                        kidnappers want that ransom money — and they clearly do, given the elaborate Bitcoin setup —
                        they need to keep her alive. Have they gotten her meds? How?</p>

                    <p>The ransom note reportedly said Nancy is "safe, but scared." I desperately want to believe that's
                        true.</p>

                    <h3>No Suspects Named — But That Doesn't Mean No Suspects</h3>

                    <p>Sheriff Nanos has been very clear: no official suspect or person of interest has been identified.
                        But he's also said "everybody's still a suspect" and that they're looking at "everybody we come
                        across in this case."</p>

                    <p>Former FBI agent Gregory Vecchi told Newsweek he's "not convinced" that law enforcement doesn't
                        have persons of interest. The operational security reasoning makes sense — if you name someone
                        too early, they lawyer up, evidence gets destroyed, and the case falls apart.</p>

                    <p>The Ashleigh Banfield situation is messy. She reported that Tommaso Cioni (Nancy's son-in-law,
                        the last person to see her) was a "prime suspect" based on a law enforcement source. Sheriff
                        Nanos called that report "reckless" and said it could "be doing some damage to the case."</p>

                    <p>I don't know what to make of that. Either Banfield has a source who shouldn't be talking, or she
                        got bad information. But the sheriff's strong pushback suggests they're trying to protect the
                        integrity of something.</p>

                    <h3>What Happens Monday?</h3>

                    <p>The second ransom deadline is Monday. The first deadline (Thursday at 5 PM) came and went with no
                        public resolution. What happens if Monday passes the same way?</p>

                    <p>I'm not a negotiator, but I've read enough about these situations to know that deadlines are
                        often fluid. The kidnappers want money. The family wants Nancy back. Law enforcement wants to
                        make an arrest. These goals don't perfectly align, and the tension between them is where things
                        get complicated.</p>

                    <div class="disclaimer-box">

                <h2 class="post-title">The Circle K Footage: What Are We Missing?</h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>Okay, let's talk about the vehicle of interest that was spotted at the Circle K on Oracle Road.
                        Because I have SO many questions and I feel like this could be huge.</p>

                    <p>First off — why Oracle Road? If you're not from Tucson, Oracle is a major north-south corridor.
                        It runs from downtown all the way up through Oro Valley and into Catalina. Nancy lives in the
                        Catalina Foothills area, which is east of Oracle but definitely accessible. So if someone was
                        heading north out of town — maybe toward Phoenix, maybe toward the middle of nowhere — Oracle
                        Road would be a logical route.</p>

                    <h3>The Timeline Problem</h3>

                    <p>Here's what's bugging me. The doorbell camera went offline at 1:47 AM. Movement was detected at
                        2:12 AM (but no footage because — and this is heartbreaking — there was no active cloud
                        subscription). The pacemaker app disconnected at 2:28 AM.</p>

                    <p>So we have roughly a 40-minute window where everything goes dark. When did this vehicle show up
                        at Circle K? Law enforcement hasn't released that detail yet, and I think it matters A LOT.</p>

                    <blockquote>"A vehicle of interest was identified at a Circle K convenience store on Oracle Road" —
                        that's all we got from the presser. No make, no model, no time stamp. Classic.</blockquote>

                    <h3>What I Think Happened</h3>

                    <p>Pure speculation here, but bear with me. If the abductor(s) knew Nancy's routine, they knew she
                        lived alone. They knew her daughter is literally Savannah Guthrie from the Today Show — which
                        means they knew there would be resources, media attention, and presumably money available for
                        ransom.</p>

                    <p>This wasn't random. This was targeted. And whoever did this was smart enough to disable the
                        doorbell camera but maybe not smart enough to avoid every gas station camera between Tucson and
                        wherever they were going.</p>

                    <h3>The Bitcoin Angle</h3>

                    <p>The ransom demanded Bitcoin. That tells me a few things:</p>
                    <p>1. They're tech-savvy enough to know about cryptocurrency<br>
                        2. They want untraceable payment (good luck with that, the FBI has gotten VERY good at tracing
                        crypto)<br>
                        3. They probably planned this for a while</p>

                    <p>But here's the thing — if you're sophisticated enough to demand Bitcoin, why send the ransom note
                        to a local TV station instead of directly to the family? KOLD-TV? Really? That's either a weird
                        flex for attention or there's something about that choice we don't understand yet.</p>

                    <div class="disclaimer-box">
                        ⚠️ <strong>Reminder:</strong> Everything above is speculation based on publicly available
                        information. I'm not law enforcement. If you have actual information about this case, please
                        contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI or submit tips at tips.fbi.gov. There's a $50,000 reward.

                <h2 class="post-title">The Imposter Problem: Who is Derrick Callella and Why Does This Keep Happening?
                </h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>I need to vent about something that makes my blood boil. While Nancy Guthrie is out there
                        somewhere — an 84-year-old woman with a pacemaker who needs daily heart medication to SURVIVE —
                        some absolute garbage human decided to send fake ransom texts to her family.</p>

                    <p>His name is Derrick Callella. He's 42 years old. He's from Hawthorne, California. And he was
                        released on $20,000 bond.</p>

                    <p>Twenty. Thousand. Dollars.</p>

                    <h3>The Psychology of Case Inserters</h3>

                    <p>This isn't the first time we've seen this in high-profile cases, and it won't be the last.
                        There's actually a term for people who insert themselves into criminal investigations — and it
                        ranges from "helpful" tipsters who make things up for attention to actual criminals who try to
                        exploit the situation.</p>

                    <p>Callella falls into the exploitation category. He saw a vulnerable family in crisis and thought
                        "you know what, I can make some money off this." The cruelty is almost incomprehensible.</p>

                    <p>But here's what concerns me from an investigative standpoint: how much time did law enforcement
                        waste chasing down his fake leads? Every hour spent verifying that his texts were bogus is an
                        hour not spent finding Nancy. Every resource diverted to arresting this clown is a resource
                        pulled from the actual case.</p>

                    <h3>Red Flags for Identifying Fake Communications</h3>

                    <p>For those following along at home, here's generally how investigators distinguish real kidnapper
                        communications from fakes:</p>

                    <p><strong>Proof of life:</strong> Real kidnappers usually provide something only they could have —
                        a photo with a current newspaper, answers to personal questions, possession of specific items.
                        The authentic messages sent to KOLD-TV apparently had enough credibility that the FBI took them
                        seriously.</p>

                    <p><strong>Communication method:</strong> Callella used text messages directly to the family. The
                        real kidnapper(s) went through a TV station. That's... an interesting choice that I'm still
                        trying to figure out.</p>

                    <p><strong>Technical sophistication:</strong> The real messages came through secure, encrypted
                        channels with different IP addresses. Callella just... texted. From his phone. In California.
                        Not exactly criminal mastermind material.</p>

                    <h3>What This Tells Us About the Real Kidnapper(s)</h3>

                    <p>The contrast between Callella's amateur hour and the actual kidnapper's methods is stark. Whoever
                        took Nancy:</p>
                    <p>• Knew how to disable a Ring doorbell camera<br>
                        • Used encrypted communication channels<br>
                        • Demanded cryptocurrency<br>
                        • Chose to communicate through media rather than directly with family<br>
                        • Has managed to avoid detection for a full week now</p>

                    <p>This is not some random opportunist. This is someone who planned. And that terrifies me.</p>

                    <div class="disclaimer-box">
                        ⚠️ <strong>Note:</strong> I want to be clear that Derrick Callella has been charged but not
                        convicted. Everyone deserves due process. That said, if the allegations are true, I hope he
                        faces the maximum penalty. Exploiting a family's worst nightmare for profit is beyond
                        despicable.

                    <span>📅 February 5, 2026</span>

                <h2 class="post-title">The Blood on the Porch: What DNA Confirmation Really Means</h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>The news dropped today that hit like a punch to the gut: the blood found on Nancy's front porch
                        has been DNA-confirmed as hers.</p>

                    <p>I've been staring at my screen for an hour trying to figure out how to write about this. Because
                        on one hand, it's devastating. On the other hand, it's evidence. And evidence is how cases get
                        solved.</p>

                    <h3>What We Can Infer</h3>

                    <p>Blood on the porch suggests a struggle. Nancy didn't go quietly. At 84 years old, with a
                        pacemaker, she fought back. That's both heartbreaking and — I don't know — somehow hopeful?
                        She's a fighter.</p>

                    <p>The location matters too. The porch. Not inside the house. This suggests the confrontation
                        happened as she was either entering or exiting, or possibly when she answered the door. Did she
                        know her attacker? Did she open the door willingly? Or was this a forced entry situation?</p>

                    <h3>The Medical Reality</h3>

                    <p>I keep coming back to her medications. All of them were found inside the home. She has a
                        pacemaker. She needs daily heart medication that, according to reports, could be fatal if not
                        taken within 24 hours.</p>

                    <p>It's been five days since she disappeared when this news broke. Five days without her heart
                        medication.</p>

                    <p>I don't want to say what we're all thinking. But whoever has her — if they want that ransom money
                        — they need to keep her alive. And keeping her alive means getting her those meds. Have they?
                        Can they? Do they even know what she needs?</p>

                    <h3>The $50,000 Question</h3>

                    <p>The FBI announced the reward the same day as the DNA confirmation. That's not a coincidence.
                        They're ramping up pressure. They want someone to talk.</p>

                    <p>$50,000 is a lot of money. If there's more than one person involved in this — and statistically,
                        kidnappings often involve multiple perpetrators — that reward might be enough to make someone
                        flip. Someone's girlfriend, someone's roommate, someone who helped and is now having second
                        thoughts...</p>

                    <p>If you know something, please. 1-800-CALL-FBI. You can remain anonymous. You could save her life.

                <h2 class="post-title">Savannah's Plea: When True Crime Becomes Too Real</h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>I watch a lot of true crime content. I read case files. I follow investigations. But today I
                        watched Savannah Guthrie — someone I've seen on TV every morning for years — beg for her
                        mother's life. And I had to step away from my computer for a while.</p>

                    <p>The video plea from the family was released today. Savannah and her siblings, looking directly
                        into the camera, addressing whoever has their mother. It wasn't polished. It wasn't scripted. It
                        was raw and desperate and absolutely gutting.</p>

                    <h3>The Strategy Behind Family Pleas</h3>

                    <p>From a tactical standpoint, family video pleas serve multiple purposes:</p>

                    <p><strong>Humanization:</strong> They remind the kidnapper that this isn't just "a victim" — this
                        is someone's mother, someone's grandmother. Someone who is loved and missed desperately.</p>

                    <p><strong>Media attention:</strong> Every news outlet picked this up. The more eyes on the case,
                        the harder it is for the perpetrator to move around undetected.</p>

                    <p><strong>Psychological pressure:</strong> Kidnappers are human too (barely). Seeing a family's
                        anguish can sometimes trigger guilt, second thoughts, or mistakes.</p>

                    <h3>Trump's Involvement</h3>

                    <p>President Trump also made a statement today, pledging "all federal resources" to the
                        investigation. Say what you want about politics, but having presidential attention on a case
                        changes things. It means FBI priority. It means resources. It means this won't quietly fade from
                        the news cycle.</p>

                    <p>I'll take any help we can get at this point.</p>

                    <h3>A Personal Note</h3>

                    <p>I started this blog because I wanted to help. I wanted to analyze and discuss and maybe notice
                        something that others missed. But watching that video today reminded me that behind every case
                        file, every evidence photo, every timeline entry — there are real people in unimaginable pain.
                    </p>

                    <p>Nancy Guthrie isn't a puzzle to be solved. She's an 84-year-old woman who should be safe at home.
                        And her family is living through the worst nightmare imaginable.</p>

                    <p>We'll find her. We have to.</p>

                    <span>📅 February 2, 2026</span>

                <h2 class="post-title">Why I'm Starting This Blog: The Nancy Guthrie Case</h2>
                <div class="post-full">
                    <p>Two days ago, an 84-year-old woman named Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in the Catalina
                        Foothills area of Tucson, Arizona. Today, authorities confirmed what many of us feared: this is
                        an abduction.</p>

                    <p>A ransom note was sent to KOLD-TV demanding Bitcoin payment. Nancy's blood was found on her front
                        porch. Her doorbell camera was disabled. Her pacemaker app went offline in the middle of the
                        night. All her medications — including critical heart medication — were left behind.</p>

                    <p>And if you're wondering why this case is getting so much national attention: Nancy is the mother
                        of Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of NBC's Today Show.</p>

                    <h3>Why This Case?</h3>

                    <p>I've followed a lot of cases over the years. But something about this one has grabbed me and
                        won't let go. Maybe it's the brazenness of it — targeting someone so high-profile. Maybe it's
                        the cruelty — taking an elderly woman who depends on daily medication to survive. Maybe it's the
                        mystery — who does something like this and thinks they'll get away with it?</p>

                    <p>I don't know yet. But I'm going to document everything I can find, analyze what we know, and
                        hopefully contribute something useful to the conversation.</p>

                    <h3>Ground Rules</h3>

                    <p>Before I go any further, some ground rules for this blog:</p>

                    <p>1. <strong>Facts first.</strong> I'll clearly label what's confirmed vs. what's speculation.<br>
                        2. <strong>Respect for the family.</strong> This is someone's mother. I won't forget that.<br>
                        3. <strong>No interference.</strong> I'm an observer and analyst, not a vigilante. If you have
                        real information, go to law enforcement.<br>
                        4. <strong>Updates as they come.</strong> I'll correct mistakes and add new information as the
                        case develops.</p>

                    <p>Let's find Nancy. 🔍</p>
